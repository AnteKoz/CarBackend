# Architecture Decision Record (Postgres)

## Use PostgreSQL for Database

*Date: 2024-06-05*

### Status

Accepted

### Context

Our current project requires a reliable and scalable database solution that supports ACID transactions and complex queries. We need to decide on a database management system to use.

### Decision

We will use PostgreSQL as our database management system.

### Consequences

- **Positive:**
    - PostgreSQL is open-source and has a strong community.
    - It supports advanced SQL features and has a robust transaction management system.
    - It is highly extensible with support for custom data types, operators, and functions.

- **Negative:**
    - The learning curve for developers unfamiliar with PostgreSQL.
    - Potential performance tuning requirements for large-scale operations.

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: MySQL

- **Pros:**
    - Widely used and has a large community.
    - Known for its reliability and ease of use.

- **Cons:**
    - Lacks some advanced SQL features found in PostgreSQL.
    - Limited extensibility compared to PostgreSQL.

#### Alternative 2: MongoDB

- **Pros:**
    - Flexible schema design.
    - Suited for hierarchical data storage.

- **Cons:**
    - No built-in support for ACID transactions in the same way relational databases provide.
    - Different query language (not SQL) which might require additional learning for the team.
