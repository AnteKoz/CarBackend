# Architecture Decision Record (Versioniring)

## Versioning Strategy for APIs

### Context

Our application requires a versioning strategy for APIs to ensure backward compatibility and smooth transitions during updates. We need a clear approach to handle changes in API endpoints without disrupting existing clients.

### Decision

We will adopt URL path versioning as our API versioning strategy. Each major version of the API will have a version number in the URL path (e.g., `/api/v1/resource`, `api/v2/resource`).
### Consequences

- **Positive:**
    - Clear and explicit versioning, making it easy for clients to understand and use.
    - Allows for significant changes between major versions without impacting existing clients.
    - Simple to implement and manage within our current infrastructure.

- **Negative:**
    - Requires duplication of some code and endpoints for different versions.
    - Can lead to increased maintenance effort as more versions are supported over time.
